# Sepia-and-Noise-Effect-Processor-C#-Windows-Forms-GUI-with-CPP-and-Assembly-DLLs
This project is an image processing application that applies a sepia filter with a noise effect to an image. The software features a Windows Forms GUI (C#) that dynamically loads two processing libraries:

C++ DLL â€“ A high-level procedural implementation.
Assembly (x86-64) DLL â€“ Optimized using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for high-performance parallel processing.
The user can choose between C++ and ASM implementations to compare performance while maintaining the same visual output.

Features
âœ” Windows Forms GUI (C#) for user-friendly interaction.
âœ” Applies a sepia filter to create an aged photo effect.
âœ” Adds a noise effect to introduce randomness in pixel values.
âœ” Two dynamically loaded DLLs:

C++ DLL â€“ Standard procedural image processing.
ASM DLL â€“ Optimized with AVX/SSE instructions for high-speed calculations.
âœ” Multithreading support â€“ Users can select 1â€“64 threads for better performance.
âœ” Execution time tracking â€“ Compare C++ vs ASM processing speeds.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
C# ( Windows Forms) â€“ GUI and DLL integration.
C++ (Visual Studio 2022, DLL) â€“ High-level image processing.
x86-64 Assembly (MASM, DLL) â€“ Optimized low-level implementation.
SIMD (AVX/SSE) â€“ Accelerated pixel processing.
Multithreading â€“ Parallel execution for speed improvement.

ðŸ“Œ Important Configuration Step
To run this project on your computer, you need to update the paths to the DLL files in Form1.cs.

By default, the DLLs are loaded using:
[DllImport(@"C:\Users\Julia\Desktop\Sepia\x64\Release\DLLCPP.dll")]
[DllImport(@"C:\Users\Julia\Desktop\Sepia\x64\Release\DLLASM.dll")]
Solution: Modify these paths to match the actual location of DLLCPP.dll and DLLASM.dll on your computer.
